# Genome Analysis ML Project

A machine learning project focused on analyzing genetic variations using neural networks and autoencoders. This project aims to process genomic data from VCF files into meaningful patterns and insights using deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview

This project implements a multi-stage pipeline for processing and analyzing genetic variants:

1. **Data Processing**: Converting raw VCF (Variant Call Format) files from genomic databases like the 1000 Genomes Project into processable formats

2. **Feature Engineering**: Transforming genetic variants into efficient numerical representations

3. **Autoencoder Implementation**: Using deep learning to create compact, meaningful representations of genetic patterns

4. **Neural Network Analysis**: Analyzing the compressed genetic data to identify patterns and make predictions

5. **Evaluation**: Implementing various metrics and visualizations to assess model performance

## Project Status

ðŸš§ Currently in early development phase:
- Establishing project structure
- Documenting pipeline architecture
- Planning initial implementations

## Technologies

- TensorFlow/Keras
- Python
- Genomic data processing libraries (planned)

## Repository Structure

Details about the repository organization and setup instructions will be added as the project develops.
